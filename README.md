# Data-Extraction-Processing
In my journey to learn data extraction and processing, I've worked on several experiments that have improved my skills. I started with file handling, learning how to read, write, and manipulate different file formats. This skill is essential for managing data efficiently.

Next, I focused on DataFrame manipulation using pandas. I learned how to create, import, and manipulate DataFrames, as well as search and filter data. This allowed me to perform basic data analysis and calculate statistics like mean and mode.

I also tackled the challenge of handling null values and outliers. I learned techniques to identify and manage missing data and outliers, ensuring the data is clean and ready for analysis. This is crucial for getting accurate results.

In my exploratory data analysis (EDA) experiments, I analyzed datasets to find patterns and insights. I used tools like SAS OnDemand and OpenRefine to help with data exploration and cleaning. These tools made it easier to uncover valuable insights from the data.

Finally, I created interactive dashboards using Power BI. This helped me visualize data insights and key metrics, making it easier for others to understand the findings.

Through these experiments, I've gained valuable skills in data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. I can now handle complex data challenges and present insights clearly and effectively. This experience has made me more confident in my ability to work with data and communicate findings.
